========================================================================
From: Statistics New Zealand

Description:
  This dataset is the definitive set of territorial authority boundaries for 2012
  as defined by the Local Government Commission and/or the territorial authorities
  themselves but maintained by Statistics New Zealand (who are the custodian). A
  Territorial Authority is defined under the local government act 2001m as a city
  or a district council.
  
  
  Territorial authorities are the second tier of local government in New Zealand,
  below regional councils. The 67 territorial authorities comprise: 12 city
  councils, 53 district councils, the Auckland Council and the Chatham Islands
  Territory. Six territorial authorities (Auckland Council, Nelson City Council,
  Gisborne , Tasman , and Marlborough District Councils) also perform the
  functions of a regional council and thus are known as unitary authorities.
  Chatham Islands Territory undertakes only some of the functions of a regional
  council, and is therefore not a unitary authority. Territorial authority
  districts are not subdivisions of regions, and some of them fall within more
  than one region. Taupo District has the distinction of straddling the boundaries
  of four different regions. Territorial authorities are based on communities of
  interest and road access and administer local roading and reserves, sewerage,
  building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management,
  and other local matters.
